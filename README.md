# Computing with Eric

My personal website, which exhibits my use of HTML, CSS, and PHP for web development.
This site showcases my work by hosting all of my software. Projects and source code
can be navigated with the viewing features provided by the backend.

The backend is made with a microservice architecture and provides public REST APIs for viewing
my software directories without having to rely on this site's frontend interface.

Information about me as a programmer and computer enthusiast are also on this website.

If you are looking for my usage of JavaScript, please look in another repo where the primary
language is JavaScript; this site is currently JavaScript free.
