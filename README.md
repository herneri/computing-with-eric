# Computing with Eric

My personal website which showcases my use of HTML, CSS, and PHP for web development. 
This site acts as a showcase of all my work by hosting all of my software.
All projects and source code can be navigated with the viewing features made possible by the backend.

The backend is made with a microservice architecture and provides public REST APIs for viewing
my software directories without having to rely on this site's frontend interface.

Information about me as a programmer and computer enthusiast are also on this website.

If you are looking for my usage of JavaScript, please look in another repo where the primary
language is JavaScript; this site is currently JavaScript free.
